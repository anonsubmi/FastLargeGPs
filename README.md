# FastOnlineGPsInLargeFields

Below is a list of all results in "Fast online Gaussian process inference for large geospatial fields", and which scripts will reproduce the results. Note that the time-results reported in "Fast online Gaussian process inference for large geospatial fields" are based on experiments on a Dell XPS 15 9560 laptop, with 16 GB RAM and an Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU running at 2.80 GHz. The times may therefore be different if the code is run on a different computer.
